        <h1>Introduction Questions</h1>
        <ol type= "1">
            <li>My name is Maeve Collins, I'm a junior in Communication Design.</li>
            <li>This class is required for my major, but I'm also interested because
                I'm hoping to minor in computer science. </li>
            <li> I have some experience with Java, because I've taken 131 and 247, 
                as well as a little bit of C from 132. But that's it. We did HTML like one
                time in Type 1 last year. </li>
            <li> I'm hoping to get a little bit more familiar with working on a screen,
                because I am very interested in animation and other mediums that combine
                art and code. 
            <li> I would anticipate the biggest issue being the fact that you want whatever
                you make to work on a desktop, on a laptop, on a mobile screen, etc. So, designs
                have to be adaptable to different ways of viewing them, which isn't the case on paper.</li>
            <li> <a href = "https://www.wayside.studio/"> Wayside Studio </a>I think this is really vsually engaging, 
                i think the choices of floating images are really cool, as well as the 
                way that the text appears as you start to explore the site. The viewer
                is pulled into the website and is more likely to actually engage with it, 
                because it is slightly mysterious. </li>
            <li> <a href = "https://www.wearecollins.com/"> COLLINS </a> I really like the way that the statistics 
            about the company are provided and kind of blip into vision as you explore the site. The 
            top right toggle tabs are also well implemented to make it simple for a user 
            to locate the information they are looking for. </li>
            <li> <a href="https://savethefishunited.com/"> Save the Fish United </a>I really love this website, its designed by a 
                a friend of mine for our brand/fundraising effort/art collective situation. I think
                that it really embodies the goals of the brand. It's still in the works, but it's mysterious, 
                it makes you think, there are some hidden pages that are hard to find, overall
                I think that the site does a great job of accomplishing the goals we had.
