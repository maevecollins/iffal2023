        <p> Serves 12. This sounds perfectly horrible but it is delicious. Guests, after raving, always try and guess the ingredients - hence the name. You won't need to worry about leftovers!The recipe only takes about 10 minutes to prepare, but will need to chill for 2-4 hours.  </p>

        <h1> Reference Websites</h1>
        </p>
        <p> <a href = https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes> Bon Apetit</a> <br> What I like about this website is the page where they have the listed recommended recipes, titles on the right and images on the left. It makes it very easy to browse through the recipes and choose one. They also have things broken down into simple text blocks, with lots of hyperlinks in the recipes. You're not asking any questions. </p>
        <p> <a href = https://www.allrecipes.com/> All Recipes </a> <br> This one I picked because of the browse page, each of the recipes are laid out into a nice grid with an image for each one. It's very easy to navigate, and they also added a feature where you can "shop the ingredients" and you can use Instacart to get the things that you need.  </p>
        <p> <a href = https://pinchofyum.com/chickpea-curry> Pinch of Yum </a> <br> The reason I really like this website is because they have a jump to recipe button, so you don't have to sift through the paragraphs of nonsense that they usually put ahead of the recipe. </p>
        <p> <a href = https://opusgrows.com/> Opus Grows </a> <br> What I really like about this website is the full image as the background, and the way that the image stays still as you scroll, while the white bar moves up. I also really enjoy the typeface choices, I think it all has very plant vibes. </p>
        <p> <a href = https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt> Open AI </a> <br> Open AI has such interesting choices of color, typeface, and graphics. It's all very sleek, and I think it's also very legible and navigable. </p>
        <p> <a href = https://impact.economist.com/> Economist Impact </a> <br> This website is so nice to look at because of the super high contrast between the type and the background. I also really enjoy the videos in the background, which are all so different but they all go together really well. </p>
