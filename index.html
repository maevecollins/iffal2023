    <header> TYPE STYLES IN CSS</header>

    <p> Type styles are used to manipulate text in HTML code. You can use them on your CSS style sheet, within different elements. For example, you could add several properties to your headers, by adding a header{} element to your style sheet. Each property you add will then be written within those {} curly brackets. You can change the body{}, p{}, h1{}, etc. Any tag in which you enclose text on your html file, can be manipulated through your style sheet. For example:</p>

    <h1> font-weight </h1>

    <p>The "font-weight" property allows you to change the <w>weight</w> of your text. You can <w>bolden</w> a word using the "font-weight: <w>bold</w>;" property in your style sheet. Or, you could write it numerically, for example, "font-weight: <w>600</w>. 400 is a pretty standard weight. Right click to nspect boldened words, and see their implementation on the style sheet. </p>

    <h1>font-style</h1>

    <p>The "font-style" property can also be used to make words or blocks of text <w>bold</w>, using "font-style: <w>bold</w>". It can also be used make words or blocks of text <fs>italicized</fs> , using "font-style: <fs>italic</fs> ". Inspect boldened or italicized words to see their implementation on the style sheet.</p>

    <h1>letter-spacing</h1>

    <p> The letter spacing property allows you to track text out, <letterout> so that letters are father apart.</letterout> This is written as "letter-spacing: 100%," as a default. A percentage about 100 will track text out, while a percentage below 100 will track text in. You can also use pixel values, which I have. The tracked out text above is at 6px, while pixel values less than 0 will track text in. <letterin> This text is tracked in by -1px.</letterin></p>

    <h1> text-transform </h1>

    <p>Text transform can be used to change the case of text, or capitalize each word. For example, I've used "text-transform: capitalize" <caps> to change the first letter of each word to a capital, although in my index.html file, they are not capitalized.</caps> "text-transform: uppercase" <uppercase> will change text to all caps.</uppercase> "text-transform: lowercase" <lowercase> WILL CHANGE ALL CAPS TEXT TO LOWERCASE.</lowercase> <br>The text transform property is especially useful for webpages written in languages other than English, with differing alphabetical systems. </p>

    <h1>text-decoration</h1>

    <p>Text decoration can be used to add different decorations to text, like underlines or overlines. You can also use "text-decoration: none;" to remove underlines or other decorations from things like a hyperlink. <wavy> For this text, I've added a "text-decoration: green wavy underline;" property. </wavy> <br>
        <overline> 
        You could also add a red overline. Or whatever you want. </overline> 
        </p>
