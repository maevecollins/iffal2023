    <header> ORIGINS by TENNIS </header>
        <p>
            [Verse 1] <br>
            Sensitive heart, you're doomed from the start <br>
            Meant to play the penitent part <br>
            Inquisitive mind, you're destined to find <br>
            Tempted fate and knowledge divine <br>
            View in there a pitied pair <br>
            Denoted by a scene unfair <br>
            Will you make my children bear <br>
            The consequences everywhere? <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Chorus] <br>
            Is it so hard to forgive the way <br>
            That we've been made to live <br>
            How much is required to set things right <br>
            Have you confused your power with mine? <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Verse 2] <br>
            View in there a pitied pair <br>
            Denoted by a scene unfair <br>
            Will you make my children bear <br>
            The consequences everywhere? <br>
            Imminent you seem to be <br>
            A picture of fragility <br>
            What is it that you think of me <br>
            Is it a woman that you see? <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            [Chorus] <br>
            Is it so hard to forgive the way <br>
            That we've been made to live <br>
            How much is required to set things right <br>
            Have you confused your power with mine? <br>
        </p>
